## How The Program Works

The nth rarest function accepts two arguments (a list, and and integer denoting the position request) as parameters and it is wrapped up by a signature function to reveal the properties of the nth rarest function.

The parameters passed into the nth rarest function **in Line 27** can be modified with new parameters.
